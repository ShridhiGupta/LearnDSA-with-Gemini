An **interactive terminal chatbot** powered by Google Gemini AI that acts as your **DSA Instructor**.

It politely explains Data Structures & Algorithms questions in the simplest way — but replies rudely if you ask anything off-topic 😅.

🖼️ Demo
Ask me anything ---> What is a stack?
Gemini: A stack is a linear data structure that follows LIFO (Last In, First Out). 
        Think of it like a stack of plates 🍽️ — you can only take or add from the top.

Ask me anything ---> How are you?
Gemini: Mind your own business! Ask some sensible question.
